# RVV-SIMD Benchmark Methodology

This document describes the methodology used for benchmarking the RVV-SIMD library and comparing its performance with equivalent implementations on x86 (AVX) and ARM (NEON) architectures.

## Benchmarking Goals

The primary goals of the benchmarking process are:

1. Measure the performance of RVV-SIMD operations on RISC-V hardware
2. Compare the performance with equivalent operations on x86 and ARM architectures
3. Identify optimization opportunities for RISC-V Vector operations
4. Provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each architecture

## Benchmark Environment

### Hardware Platforms

The benchmarks are designed to run on three different hardware platforms:

1. **RISC-V Platform**:
   - RISC-V processor with Vector extension (RVV)
   - Minimum VLEN (vector register length) of 128 bits
   - Example platforms: SiFive U74, Allwinner D1, QEMU RISC-V emulation

2. **x86 Platform**:
   - x86-64 processor with AVX2 support
   - Example platforms: Intel Core i7/i9, AMD Ryzen

3. **ARM Platform**:
   - ARMv8 processor with NEON support
   - Example platforms: Apple M1/M2, Qualcomm Snapdragon, NVIDIA Jetson

### Software Environment

- Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or newer)
- Compiler: GCC 10+ or Clang 10+
- Benchmarking Framework: Google Benchmark
- Build System: CMake 3.10+

## Benchmark Categories

The benchmarks are organized into three main categories:

### 1. Core Vector Operations

- Vector addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Vector dot product
- Vector scaling
- Vector normalization
- Mathematical functions (exp, log, sigmoid, tanh, ReLU)

### 2. Matrix Operations

- Matrix addition, subtraction, element-wise multiplication
- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix transposition
- Matrix scaling
- Matrix norms

### 3. Machine Learning Operations

- Convolution operations
- Pooling operations (max, average)
- Batch normalization
- Softmax
- Cross-entropy loss

## Benchmark Methodology

### Measurement Approach

1. **Warm-up Phase**: Each benchmark includes a warm-up phase to eliminate cold-start effects.

2. **Multiple Iterations**: Each operation is executed multiple times to obtain statistically significant results.

3. **Time Measurement**: The benchmarks measure wall-clock time using high-resolution timers.

4. **Throughput Calculation**: Throughput is calculated as operations per second or elements processed per second.

5. **Memory Usage**: Memory usage is tracked to identify potential memory bottlenecks.

### Data Sizes

The benchmarks use various data sizes to evaluate performance across different workloads:

- **Small Data**: Fits entirely in L1 cache (e.g., vectors of 1K-4K elements)
- **Medium Data**: Fits in L2/L3 cache but not L1 (e.g., vectors of 16K-256K elements)
- **Large Data**: Exceeds cache size (e.g., vectors of 1M+ elements)

### Implementation Details

#### RISC-V Vector (RVV) Implementation

The RVV implementation uses RISC-V Vector intrinsics provided by the RISC-V Vector extension:

```cpp
// Example: Vector addition using RVV intrinsics
size_t vl;
for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i += vl) {
    vl = __riscv_vsetvl_e32m8(length - i);
    vfloat32m8_t va = __riscv_vle32_v_f32m8(a + i, vl);
    vfloat32m8_t vb = __riscv_vle32_v_f32m8(b + i, vl);
    vfloat32m8_t vresult = __riscv_vfadd_vv_f32m8(va, vb, vl);
    __riscv_vse32_v_f32m8(result + i, vresult, vl);
}
```

#### x86 (AVX) Implementation

The x86 implementation uses AVX/AVX2 intrinsics:

```cpp
// Example: Vector addition using AVX intrinsics
const size_t step = 8;  // AVX processes 8 floats at a time
for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i += step) {
    __m256 va = _mm256_loadu_ps(a + i);
    __m256 vb = _mm256_loadu_ps(b + i);
    __m256 vresult = _mm256_add_ps(va, vb);
    _mm256_storeu_ps(result + i, vresult);
}
```

#### ARM (NEON) Implementation

The ARM implementation uses NEON intrinsics:

```cpp
// Example: Vector addition using NEON intrinsics
const size_t step = 4;  // NEON processes 4 floats at a time
for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i += step) {
    float32x4_t va = vld1q_f32(a + i);
    float32x4_t vb = vld1q_f32(b + i);
    float32x4_t vresult = vaddq_f32(va, vb);
    vst1q_f32(result + i, vresult);
}
```

#### Scalar Implementation

A scalar (non-SIMD) implementation is included as a baseline:

```cpp
// Example: Vector addition using scalar operations
for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    result[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}
```

## Benchmark Metrics

The following metrics are collected for each benchmark:

1. **Execution Time**: Time taken to complete the operation (lower is better)
2. **Throughput**: Elements processed per second (higher is better)
3. **Speedup**: Relative performance compared to scalar implementation
4. **Memory Bandwidth**: Memory throughput in GB/s
5. **Energy Efficiency**: Operations per watt (where hardware monitoring is available)

## Cross-Architecture Comparison

The cross-architecture comparison focuses on:

1. **Raw Performance**: Absolute performance of each architecture
2. **Scaling Behavior**: How performance scales with data size
3. **Efficiency**: Performance per watt and performance per core
4. **Instruction Count**: Number of instructions executed for equivalent operations

## Visualization and Reporting

The benchmark results are visualized using:

1. **Bar Charts**: For comparing performance across architectures
2. **Line Charts**: For showing scaling behavior with data size
3. **Tables**: For detailed numeric results

Example visualization:

```
Performance Comparison: Vector Addition (1M elements)
|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Architecture| Time (ms)  | Speedup   | GB/s      |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| RISC-V (RVV)| X.XX       | X.XX      | XX.XX     |
| x86 (AVX)   | X.XX       | X.XX      | XX.XX     |
| ARM (NEON)  | X.XX       | X.XX      | XX.XX     |
| Scalar      | X.XX       | 1.00      | XX.XX     |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
```

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Hardware Variations**: Different implementations of the same architecture may have different performance characteristics.

2. **Compiler Optimizations**: Compiler version and optimization flags can significantly impact performance.

3. **Memory Subsystem**: Differences in cache sizes, memory bandwidth, and memory latency affect performance.

4. **Instruction Set Versions**: Different versions of SIMD instruction sets (e.g., AVX vs. AVX2 vs. AVX-512) have different capabilities.

5. **Emulation Effects**: When running on emulated environments, performance may not reflect actual hardware performance.

## Reproducing Benchmarks

To reproduce the benchmarks:

1. Clone the RVV-SIMD repository
2. Build the benchmarks with `cmake` and `make`
3. Run the benchmark executable:
   ```bash
   ./benchmarks/rvv_simd_benchmarks
   ```

4. For cross-architecture comparison, run the benchmarks on different hardware platforms and collect the results.

## Conclusion

The benchmark methodology is designed to provide a fair and comprehensive comparison of RISC-V Vector performance against established SIMD architectures. By using consistent measurement techniques and a wide range of operations and data sizes, the benchmarks aim to give users a clear understanding of the relative performance characteristics of each architecture.
